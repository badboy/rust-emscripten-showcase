Hey, I'm here to tell you a bit about how we can use Rust in fields you wouldn't even expect.
You're here, so actually you might expect these fields.

first a bit about me

I tend to be a busy person.
I'm skipping some classes at university to be here.

Apart form that I am normally also a software developer as well as open source enthusiast.

I'm using Rust for a little bit over 2 years now, after being frustrasted with a large C++ project.
Rust promised to be better.
Since then I stuck with it, released a dozen of crates, organized meetups and the recent first European Rust conference, RustFest in Berlin

# Aachen, Germany

???

I'm from this little town called Aachen, 
far in the west of Germany, right next to the Netherlands and Belgium.

Which is nice, because you get to have nice dutch or belgian fries.

We also have this Lebkuchen-like pastry called Printen.

I even brought some, these are "Kräuterprinten" 

Please grab some.

Non-hungry people are easier to talk to ;)

Ok, with that out of the way, let's get to the topic.

When I began with Rust, I wanted a replacement for C++.
But I actually come from a background of web development. Both on the backend and frontend.
So other things are far better known to me.

Like JavaScript.

In the beginning, even a bit before my time, all there was was HTML. 
Only in 1995 JavaScript came to be.
It was used to make sites all a bit more dynamic.
Handle user interaction, enhance the website usage by modifying or extending the content.

This core idea still floats around.

It was really simple in the beginning and maybe a bit slow.
JavaScript was a purely interpreted language.
We all know that's ok, but not the fastest approach.

People tend to use it more and more and the JavaScript engines embedded into browsers had to cope with it.
So they got better. And faster.

Today we have highly specialized JavaScript engines like v8 and SpiderMonkey, with JIT compilation or maybe even AOT-Compilation.

People started to getting annoyed of JavaScript, 
but it was still the only language that was widely available in browsers.
Sure, we had Flash or Java-Applets. But these were still addons.

People wanted to use other languages and by the lack of availability, they took what they had and compiled it to JavaScript.
This way it could run in the browser.

Google mit GWT: Java (2006)

![Emscripten](media/emscripten-logo.png)

## LLVM to JavaScript compiler

## Run C on the web at near-native speed

???

Slightly later, in 2010 Emscripten came to be.

Take your C or C++ code, run it through LLVM,
take this output and compile it to some low-level JavaScript.

This allowed to run your boring old C code _in the browser_
at near-native speed.

---
class: gif
background-image: url(media/why.gif)

???

You now all have that one question: why?

---
class: center, middle

# Compile to the web

### JS is standards-based, runs everywhere
### Avoid high cost of porting code
### Reuse existing native libraries

???

Well, JavaScript is a standard. 
It works everywhere.
From your smartphone all to your server.
You don't have to think about the distribution. 
If there's a browser, it has JavaScript.

Using this approach it is possible to avoid the effort to port your huge project into JavaScript.
Just recompile it.

And of course it is now possible to re-use existing libraries.
Just recently I saw the Tesseract.js project.
It took the OCR library tesseract, compiled it to JavaScript and now we have great OCR in the browser.

class: center, middle

# [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/)

## a subset of JavaScript

???

Now the thing with Emscripten is, the JavaScript it spits out is far from readable.
It uses a lot of tricks to make it fast and efficient.
The advantage: it still is just JavaScript, every browser should be able to execute it.

However, the tricks it uses can now be detected by browsers to make it even more efficient.
JavaScript engines can optimize this code.

So from what Emscripten did people went a bit further and wrote a specification of the things Emscripten did.

It's called asm.js.
It's still a subset of JavaScript, but Engines know it and can genereate more efficient runtime code.
Or apply things like AOT compilation.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">asm.js code is very simple and low-level, and as a result easy</p>&mdash; Horse JS (@horse_js) <a href="https://twitter.com/horse_js/status/575000441177550848">March 9, 2015</a></blockquote>

???

So if asm.js is a subset of JavaScript, it is simple and easy, right?

---

# (Implicitely) typed

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  x = x|0;
  y = y|0;
  return (x + y)|0;
}
```

???

JavaScript has only some basic types: 
numbers, which are actually floats,
strings,
and objects. 

This doesn't give us a lot of safety.
The specification of asm.js however _has_ types

A binary or of a number with zero shouldn't change its value.
The addition of two values, then binary-ored with zero shouldn't change the result.

---
class: middle, code, big

# (Implicitely) typed

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
* x = x|0; // 32-bit value
  y = y|0;
  return (x + y)|0;
}
```

???

However, it can change its type.
Binary or only makes sense with an integer. 
So whatever is the result of this operation can only be an integer.

This is how in asm.js you specify the type. Binary-Or always means an integer.

Engines that do understand asm.js can pick this up, turn the values into 32-bit
integers and perform the same assembly instruction you would get if that
function would have been written in C.

Firefox's JavaScript engine is specialized and even has a AoT compilation mode if it detects asm.js code

---
class: middle, code, big

# Emulated heap

```c
size_t strlen(char *ptr) {
  char *curr = ptr;
  while (*curr != 0) {
    curr++;
  }
  return (curr - ptr);
}
```

???

The memory model of languages like C, C++ and even Rust rely on a simple concept:
Memory can be addressed by pointers.
And you can do wild pointer arithmetic pointing _anywhere_

For example a simple string length function in C would just count the bytes between the start of the pointer and the first nul byte in the string.
Easy to do with pointer arithmetic.

---
class: middle, code, big

# Emulated heap

```javascript
function strlen(ptr) {
  ptr = ptr|0;
  var curr = 0;
  curr = ptr;
  while (HEAP8[curr]|0 != 0) {
    curr = (curr + 1)|0;
  }
  return (curr - ptr)|0;
}
```

???

JavaScript does not have pointers.
But it can be emulated.

Just take a typed array, HEAP8 in that example 
and the pointers are just numeric offsets into that array.

This way even code that allocates can be translated into JavaScript.
Additionally this completely avoids the garbage collector.

JavaScript sees no garbage, only one large array that's always in use.
Of course this means short small programs have quite some overhead,
but long-running ones don't!

# [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/)

## a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.


???

New Target: WebAssembly.

a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.

that's a lot, let's break it down

---
class: center, middle

# [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/)

## a new <span style="visibility:hidden">portable, size- and load-time-efficient</span> format suitable for compilation to the web.

???

a new format suitable for compilation to the web.

so a new format, that ever browser should understand.
We did have such things already: Flash, Java and other Plugins

So what's better this time?
All major browser vendors are part of the working group.
They explicitely don't want a replacement for JavaScript.
They want something that can happily live side-by-side

???

The working group of WebAssembly is just one year old.
They already reached some ambitious goals like a PoC in Chrome and Firefox.
If you enable it.

So yeah, how about we all write a bit of Lisp again?

# Wasm

## a binary format (of the AST)
## fast to parse
## native support in Chrome & Firefox *

.footnote[\* experimental]

???

But the text format of WebAssembly is only one part.
The more important part is actually the binary format.

It should be small, fast to parse & compressable
Chrome & Firefox have parsers & execution engines for this format.

---
class: gif
background-image: url(media/why2.gif)

???

So again: why?

Why not?

---
class: center, middle

# Why WebAssembly

## faster decoding than JavaScript (up to 20×)
## less restrictions than asm.js
## thread & SIMD support *

.footnote[\* planned]

???

Benchmarks show that decoding this is a lot faster. Roughly 20 times as fast.

It also is not bound to JavaScript semantics anymore.

This makes it easier to lay threading & SIMD support on top
Both is planned for stage 2 of WebAssembly.

# The story with Rust

## It worked once *

.footnote[\* It was hacky]

???

So, we now kknow emscripten, asm.js and WebAssembly.
Let's talk about Rust.

In Rust compiling to JavaScript using Emscripten worked once, but it was hacky, required to patch & compile 
the compiler.

Emscripten uses its own fork of LLVM. 
It did not upstream these changes and it diverged a bit from the main project.

So bringing it all back together is a bit hard.

---
class: center, middle, huge, gif, finally
background-image: url(media/yes-finally2.gif)

# [#34743](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34743)

???

To actually get Emscripten support in Rust,
we first needed a common base, meaning we had to upgrade the used LLVM to 3.9

After only 167 comments, 33 commits, 22 changed files, a dozen buildbot runs and 5 bors retries,
we managed to get this merged.

Now both Rust and Emscripten were on something that's more like LLVM 3.9

---
class: center, middle, gif, doh
background-image: url(media/doh.gif)

# [Only 10 more steps](https://gist.github.com/badboy/5b905e71cf41a83724da9f96ee14b5fe)

???

With that upgrade it were only about 10 more steps to get a working compiler.
Some changes to rustc were still necessary, and a up2date version of emscripten had to be installed.

it got us closer

---
class:

# [#36339: Working asmjs and wasm targets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/36339)

## Merged Emscripten's LLVM additions
## Ignores a lot of tests
## Wasm through asm.js

???

Then brson moved this work further along

He managed to merge a minimal compatibility patch of LLVM, 
that makes it possible to create the right target machines and spit out LLVM IR that Emscripten understands.

He also fixed or ignored a lot of tests.

And while on it he also added a WebAssembly target.

# Only 5 more steps


.footnote[\* rustup gets you the standard library]

???

So now only 5 more steps left

And since some nightly versions, Rustup does all the hard part of installing the standard library

# Rust to Wasm

## Remember MIR?

???

So now we have a working Rust-to-JavaScript compiler and a WebAssembly target.

But there's also another approach.

Remember MIR?

that's the new Intermediate Representation of Rust

---
class: center, middle

# Rust to Wasm

## New backend for rustc
## In parallel to other efforts
## works today: [mir2wasm](https://github.com/brson/mir2wasm)

???

With this change it is possible to create a new backend for rustc 
that takes MIR and compiles it directly to WebAssembly.

Completely bypassing LLVM and Emscripten.

This is done in mir2wasm, a project based on the ideas of the MIR-Interpreter miri.
It re-uses an existing WebAssembly compiler and spits out working webassembly code.

---
class: middle, code, increased

## Rust

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

???

So given this small snippet of Rust code, a simple addition, 
we want to compile that to WebAssembly

---
class: middle, code

## MIR

```rust
fn add(arg0: i32, arg1: i32) -> i32 {
    scope 1 {
        let var0: i32;            // "x" in scope 1 at fact.rs:2:12: 2:13
        let var1: i32;            // "y" in scope 1 at fact.rs:2:20: 2:21
    }
    let mut tmp0: i32;
    let mut tmp1: i32;

    bb0: {
        var0 = arg0;              // scope 0 at fact.rs:2:12: 2:13
        var1 = arg1;              // scope 0 at fact.rs:2:20: 2:21
        tmp0 = var0;              // scope 1 at fact.rs:3:5: 3:6
        tmp1 = var1;              // scope 1 at fact.rs:3:9: 3:10
        return = Add(tmp0, tmp1); // scope 1 at fact.rs:3:5: 3:10
        goto -> bb1;              // scope 1 at fact.rs:2:1: 4:2
    }

    bb1: {
        return;                   // scope 1 at fact.rs:2:1: 4:2
    }
}
```

.footnote[rustc -Z unstable-options --unpretty mir -O add.rs]

???

First step: translate it to MIR.
Gets a bit more complex, but we can still see the operation: Addition of tmp0 and tmp1

---
class: middle, code, increased

## Wast

```lisp
(func $add (type $rustfn-0-2)
           (param $0 i32) (param $1 i32)
           (result i32)
  (i32.add
    (get_local $0)
    (get_local $1)
  )
)
```

???

mir2wasm takes this and now translates it into WebAssembly.
The text representation looks like this.

So that works as well!
